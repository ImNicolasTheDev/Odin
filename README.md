# Odin
This app is made in .NET MAUI. It helps students to see their schedule and their marks faster, by autoconnecting them.  
### 📄 Pages
**The first page (Home)** contains a WebView, of course, and some buttons to navigate easily. It opens the *default link* stored in *Preferences*, and if there's a username and a password stored in *SecureStorage*, it logs you in directly to the *default link*.  
**The second page (Options)** has the user-tokens management, where the user can save and show their information in and from the *SecureStorage*. The user can set a default page to open when the app starts. This value is stored (as previously said) in *Preferences*.  

I hope you'll enjoy this simple yet useful app! ✨

### Coming in future releases :
*- A button to disconnect yourself and close the app* ✔️
*- A color picker to change the appearance of the navigation bar!* ✔️
